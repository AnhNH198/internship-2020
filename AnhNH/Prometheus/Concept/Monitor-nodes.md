# Monitor nodes
*   To monitor nodes, we need to install node-exporter
*   Node exporter will expose machine metrics of linux / *Nix machines
    *   Example: cpu usage, memory usage

*   Node exporter can be used to monitor machines, and later on, we can create alerts based on these ingested metrics
